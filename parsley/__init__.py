## Parsley.
##
## Very roughly, parlsey consists of
## - An engine which can execute arbitrary things in parsley.engine
## - An abstract base implementation for synchronization tasks in parsley.sync.abstract
## - A powerful synchronization task implementation in parsley.sync.infs.InFsSync
## - Some helping hands at different places like parsley.logger, parsley.preparations or parsley.tools
## - A boring gui for the first few minutes in parsley.gui
